1. Memory model_8 species_Heaviside function.ipynb: This Python notebook contains code to simulate 8 species communities using equations 1 and 2 (Fig. 3A).
2. Parameter_values_CM_Simulations_Heaviside_function.py: This file contains the exact parameters for simulating 8-species communities using equations 1 and 2. Parameters include:
     A. Community compositions (N1, N2,...)
     B. Optimum p values for each species (po)
     C. k values for each species (k)
     D. Steady-state p values for each species (pstst)
3. Memory model_8 species_Gaussian function.ipynb: This Python notebook contains code to simulate 8 species communities using equations 3 and 4 (Supplementary Fig. 10).
4. Parameter_values_CM_Simulations_Gaussian_function.py: This file contains the exact parameters for simulating 8-species communities using equations 1 and 2. Parameters include:
